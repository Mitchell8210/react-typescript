# react-typescript

### Explaination
This project is to be used as a simple example or boilerplate set up to use React.js and Typescript on the client side of the application and Node.js and Express for the API on the backend. 

### Steps to clone and run the application
To run the application you first need to Clone the repository into a directory on your command line. To use git, you can type:

:rocket: git clone <copied link to this repository located in the top right of the repository page.>

after you have cloned the repository you can cd into the file, or if you are already in the file, you can run the application by typing "npm run dev" in the command line if you have npm installed on your machine.

the application should open a window on your browser automatically and in a few moments, should render the boilerplate that I have set up.

### Sidenote
This can easily be changed to be used how you need it for your application or project that you are working on. I have not set up a state management system on the boilerplate. If you would like to contribute to this project or add to this boilerplate, by all means create a push request and I will hapily review it and add in new features as they are presented. 

This is NOT a fully built out application and there is still much that is needed to get it to become one. but it is a simple starting point that I believe could be helpful in getting familiar with how a server and client can interact with one another
